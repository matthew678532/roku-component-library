# ConsoleComponent

ðŸš§ **Component under construction**

Component to wrap BrightScripts print function for finer control over output. Named console as the intention is to implement a very similar spec to that of the console web api (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console). Certain functionality may not be available/work as intended if theres no logical cross over between the runtimes (Roku vs Web) - these methods will be tracked here for reference and shared understanding.

## How To


## Api

| Method | Description | Example Usage |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `console.log` | Logs a message to the console | `console.log("Hello")` |
